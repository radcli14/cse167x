## Lecture 1 (Course Overview)

### Graphics Pipeline

- Pipeline Definition
  - Modeling (creating 3D geometry and textures)
  - Animation
  - Rendering (create realistic images considering geometry and animation)
 
- Rasterization (homework 2)
  - Goes through all geometric primitives, determine where they exist on the screen

- Raytracing (homework 3)
  - Goes through all pixels, and determines what geometry are in that pixel

### Historical Methods

- Diffuse lighting (Gourad), smooth shading, lessens facet edges
- Specular lighting (Phong), adds highlights, plastic appearance with body color component and specular highlight
- Curved surface and texture (Blinn)
- Z-Buffer (Catmull), hidden surface
- Global illumination (Whitted), recursive raytracing, bubble refraction image
- Radiosity (Goral, Torrance), interacting and reflecting light where one object illuminates another
- Rendering equation (Kajiya), unified many of the methods and visual phenomena
