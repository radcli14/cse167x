### Graphics Pipeline

- Pipeline Definition
  - Modeling (creating 3D geometry and textures)
  - Animation
  - Rendering (create realistic images considering geometry and animation)
 
- Rasterization (homework 2)
  - Goes through all geometric primitives, determine where they exist on the screen

- Raytracing (homework 3)
  - Goes through all pixels, and determines what geometry are in that pixel
